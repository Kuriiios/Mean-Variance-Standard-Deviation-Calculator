# Project Description

I'm using this project to practice my Python and Numpy skills with the Gitpod starter code.
Task

I will create a calculate() function in mean_var_std.py that:

    Accepts a list of 9 numbers
    Converts the list into a 3x3 Numpy array
    Returns a dictionary with the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements

If the input list has fewer than 9 numbers, the function will raise a ValueError.
Unit Tests

Unit tests are included in test_module.py to verify the accuracy of the calculate() function. They check the functionâ€™s output against expected results for various inputs, ensuring correctness and proper error handling.
